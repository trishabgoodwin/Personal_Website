    <p class="aboutBlurb">
        I'm a lifelong learner and love a good challenge. I have strong family values
        and love to help others. I spend my free time with my family or challenging myself
        with something new. <br>
        <br>
        For the over ten years I have devoted myself to the education of others, while maintainig
        rigorous expectations for myself as a professional and team player, as well. I'm exited
        to being the pursuit of a career that will allow me to showcase my work ethic and teamworking 
        skills while providing numerous opportunites for growth and success.
